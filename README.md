My progress and impressions:)

## Git Basics

I previously tried to use git but mostly used only the main commands: git init/add/commit/pull/push/merge. 
These courses helped to structure information and understand how to work with GitHub. The [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) course was very interesting and helped to consolidate knowledge.
What surprised me and what I am going to use in the future - "cherry-pick" and "reba se".

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Learning the command line was something new to me. I'm glad I finally figured out the difference between shell/bash/terminal and command line. I will try to use terminal commands to navigate the file system and create/move/delete files. Particularly pleased with the ability to immediately open VSCode from the terminal, and install programs if there is a package manager.

## Git Collaboration

After finishing "git basics" part of course, "git collaboration" was quite easy.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I took these courses earlier so I just refreshed my knowledge.

## Responsive Web Design

In this course, it was interesting to learn about emulators/simulators, developing tools for mobile, what is viewport and DIP, picking breakpoints and intro to pattern.

## JavaScript Basics

Passing FreeCodeCamp was very useful: I review the basic principles of JS, but the most interesting part of this task are learning ES6 features (constructor, getters, setters) and resolving alghorithms tasks - it was a real challenge.

## JS DOM

Udacity course was very useful: specially information about page rendering, reviewing basic DOM methods and how reflow and repainting affect perfomance, also Virtual DOM.
