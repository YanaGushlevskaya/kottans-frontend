My progress and impressions:)

## Git Basics

I previously tried to use git but mostly used only the main commands: git init/add/commit/pull/push/merge. 
These courses helped to structure information and understand how to work with GitHub. The [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) course was very interesting and helped to consolidate knowledge.
What surprised me and what I am going to use in the future - "cherry-pick" and "rebase".
